## Goal

Predict son's height based on father's height


--- &twocol

## Model

*** =left

> A linear model built with the father.son dataset

- library(UsingR)
- data("father.son")

> lm(sheight ~ fheight, data = father.son)

*** =right

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
      library(UsingR)
      data("father.son")
   
      model <- lm(sheight ~ fheight, data = father.son) 
      par( mar= c(4,4,0,2))
      plot(father.son$fheight, father.son$sheight,
               xlab = "Father's Height",
               ylab = "Son's Height")
          abline(model, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

## How to input father's height

- Click and Slide the horizontal bar at the bottom of the page.
- A numeric value shows above the cursor. 
- Father's height changes in steps of 0.25 inches.
- Releasing the mouse will select an input value.

## Prediction of Son's Height


- Predicted son's height will show in bold red number about the input bar.
- a big red dot will be plotted in the graph.

               xlab = "Father's Height",
               ylab = "Son's Height")
          abline(model, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
          points(69, 69.36, col = "red", pch = 19,  cex = 3)
